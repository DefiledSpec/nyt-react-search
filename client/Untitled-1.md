# Market Summary

Upon my exploratory search of the current institutional floor care market offerings of hand held equipment and devices including
professional machines revealed numerous offerings of varied and like machines and equipment.

With regards to the length of time I have been involved with and close to the sanitation process, more so than not evolution of design or actual changes in approach regarding function reflected little or no innovation or breakthrough concepts.
How ever in contrast several new concept designs targeted at the housewares market did appear over this time period. A few innovations which align with my own personal predisposition towards more disposable refill technologies had gained a foothold as an alternative to  the more traditional products. - `cotton mop heads`

So at first blush I find an industry bursting with opportunity and much needed room for improvement; not unlike or not too different when as a young innovator/inventor I introduced to the industry a complete total handheld cleaning system that was universally adaptable to one common Fas-Loc handle, for ever ending the chaotic mess of the average typical janitorial closet.

So at this early stage having just awoken from my 25 year slumber since I first introduced the Fas-Loc System, `an industry first`. I am proposing to myself and declaring to all interested my intentions, not to just improve and upgrade my first invention that is as viable now as it was then, but rather recommit to the innovative process and revisit the challenge of delivering a clean, safe and more sanitary environment.

I will declare and direct all creative intellect and effort towards the development of a device or devices that raises the bar, and sets a new cleanliness standard much broader in its scope and far more reaching in its effectiveness than my previous efforts.
